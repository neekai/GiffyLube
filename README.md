## Intro

Hello, and welcome to GiffyLube!

This is my first time developing with Next.js and using TypeScript. I've heard many good things about Next.js and have always
wanted to learn TypeScript. When I discovered that Next.js has built-in support for TypeScript, I decided that this would be the time to get
my hands dirty.

Hopefully this app meets your expectations and let's get started!

## Getting Started

First, create an .env.local file in the root directory

Copy and paste the env variables into the .env.local file

- I have uploaded the env variables to the project submit link and emailed to Takashi as well.

Now we're ready to go!

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.
